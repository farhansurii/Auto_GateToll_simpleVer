# Final Project: Automatic Toll Gate System ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
This project is the final assignment for the Basic Control Systems practicum, focusing on creating an automatic control system. As per the requirements, this project involves the use of a sensor, an actuator, and a microcontroller.

The system developed is an Automatic Toll Gate System. To detect the presence of a vehicle, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor is used. A servo motor acts as the actuator, functioning as the toll gate barrier. The entire system is controlled by an ESP32 V1 (Type C) microcontroller.

To further clarify the system's status and operation, this project also includes a buzzer for audible indication and an LED for visual indication. ðŸš¦ðŸ””
